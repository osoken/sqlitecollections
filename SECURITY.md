## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in sqlitecollections, please email sqlitecollections-admin@osoekawalab.com with the following contents:
- the steps you took to create the issue
- affected versions
- if you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach it

We will evaluate the vulnerabilities and release a fix or mitigation if necessary.
We will contact you with the results and include your name in the report.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability until a fix is released.
Once we either a) release a fix or b) refuse to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publish it.
